# ShowYourTrails

## Overview
[ShowYourTrails](https://showyourtrails.tech) is a Django-based web application enabling users to upload, share, and explore personalized hiking/biking trails with friends. 

Why I created the applictaion? 

I finished Camino de Santiago in Sep 2023 (Camino del Norte and Camino Primitivo). <br>
I wanted to showcase the footprints of my journey, but I find the presentation of journey records in existing apps unsatisfying. Therefore, I've decided to write my own.

The platform features analysis of trail and athlete statistics (distance, elevation gain, duration, speed‚Ä¶), 
display of trails on an interactive map, 
showcasing elevation profiles for a comprehensive user experience.
